# Fast-Sunrise-Sunset

This library is optimization of https://github.com/udivankin/sunrise-sunset for repeated large scale sunrise/sunset calculations for multiple location. 

This library is probably **NOT** the library you're looking for. For one time or user driven sunrise/sunset calculation https://github.com/udivankin/sunrise-sunset has more user friendly interface.

For correct usage see `src/__tests__`

N.B. Some important bugs inherited from original lib where fixed. See https://github.com/udivankin/sunrise-sunset/issues/19#issuecomment-843575684

N.B. This library results deviate with up to two minutes from more complicated calculations from https://www.suncalc.org/ and alike, but I find the results useful given how stretchy definition of sunrise/sunset can be.
